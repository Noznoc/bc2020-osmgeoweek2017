# BC2020 OSMGeoWeek 2017 Results

From November 10 - 20, 2017, Canadian colleges, universities, and organizations participated in Building Canada 2020 (BC2020) mapathons for OSMGeoWeek! BC2020 is a community-led project to map all building footprints by 2020 on [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org). Click [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Canada/Building_Canada_2020) to learn more about the project. The mapathons educated students how to map buildings with OSM tools. Participants armchaired mapped Canadian regions that are not represented in OSM and do not have a open building footprint dataset that can be imported. You can read more about the BC2020 mapathons [here](https://blog.mapbox.com/osmgeoweek-mapathons-support-building-canada-2020-eb0ca4edf8fe).

The [visualization](https://noznoc.github.io/bc2020-osmgeoweek2017/#4/54.32/-99.93) shows the total amount of buildings mapped by the participants for each group who hosted a mapathon between November 10 and 20, 2017. 

The source data is accessible [here](https://github.com/Noznoc/bc2020-osmgeoweek2017/tree/master/data). If you are a professor/supervisor who wants to assess your mapathon participants' contributions. Select the `[place].geojson` file that matches the name of the region your mapathon mapped.

**Although there are now existing buildings within scarcely mapped reigon, it is important to still conduct validation**. The visualization is developed to support validation efforts. View the gif above to see how. Refer to [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Canada/Building_Canada_2020/OSMGeoWeek2017#Validation) for documentation on validation practices.
